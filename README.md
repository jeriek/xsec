## Installation

xsec is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. The following Python libraries are required to run xsec:
- setuptools v20.7.0 or later
- numpy v1.14 or later
- scipy v1.0.0 or later
- joblib v0.12.2 or later
- pySLHA v3.2.0 or later

xsec can be installed from PyPI using regular pip commands, *e.g.*
```
pip install xsec
```
optionally with the `--user` flag if your IT-department is mean.

Alternatively, you can clone the repo from GitHub, `cd` into it, and then run
```
pip install --user .
```
It is also possible to use the content of the cloned repo as a module without installing.

To uninstall: 
```
pip uninstall xsec
```
To install only the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `pip` installation **doesn't automatically include the data** required to run. To download data after pip installation, ensure that the pip install directory for scripts, *e.g.* `~/.local/bin`, is in `$PATH`, and execute the following shell command:
```
xsec-download-gprocs [<directory-for-xsec-data>]
```
If no argument is given, the data will be extracted in a new `gprocs` directory created in the current working directory, otherwise the user-specified path is used. If you have not pip installed xsec, the same script can be executed from the `scripts` folder.

To check whether the xsec installation finds the data correctly, try a test cross-section evaluation:
```
xsec-test [<directory-for-xsec-data>]
```
If no argument is given, the data is assumed to be in a `gprocs` directory in the current working directory, otherwise the user-specified path is used.

An example main programme showing how to use the module can be found in the [`example_xsec_eval.py`](examples/example_xsec_eval.py) file. This shows evaluation both by specifying the model parameters by hand and by importing an SLHA file. An example showing a simple loop over parameters can be found as [`example_xsec_loop.py`](examples/example_xsec_loop.py)
